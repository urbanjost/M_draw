.SH NAME
M_draw(3fm) - [M_draw::INTRO] The M_draw graphics library
(LICENSE:PD)

.SH DESCRIPTION

M_draw is a portable public-domain device-independent graphics library
intended for being called from Fortran that is based on VOGLE (from
the University of Melbourne) that is loosely based on the Silicon
Graphics Iris GL library. It was also partly inspired by the DIGS
library developed at the U.S. Naval Academy under the guidance of
Prof David Rogers.

M_draw is intended to produce simple graphics composed of line drawings and
polygon fills in two and three dimensions. It handles circles, curves,
arcs, patches, polygons, and software text in a device independent
fashion. Simple hidden line removal is also available via polygon
backfacing. Access to hardware text and double buffering of drawings
depends on the driver.
.PP
M_draw is callable from C and Fortran, and Pascal;
but M_draw is only supported in Fortran (the C components are being converted
to Fortran).

.SS   ROUTINES FOR SETTING UP WINDOWS
.TP
.B prefposition(x, y)
Specify preferred position of window
.TP
.B prefsize(width, height)
Specify preferred width and height of window
.PP
Some devices are basically window oriented - like sunview and X11. You
can give M_draw some information on the window that it will use with these
routines. These can make your code very device independent. Both routines
take arguments which are in device space. (0, 0) is the top left hand
corner in device space. To have any effect these routines must be called
before vinit. For the X11 device, an entry may be made in your .Xdefaults
file or loaded in with the xrdb(1) command:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      xrdb <<\\end_of_file
      ! X11 Windows fonts to use for "small" and "large" fonts
      M_draw*smallfont: fixed
      M_draw*largefont: 9x15
      ! title on decoration bar for the window
      M_draw*title: My M_draw program
      ! window geometry and position,
      ! overridden by prefsize(3c) and prefposition(3c)
      M_draw.Geometry: =500x500-10+20
      end_of_file

.PP
On some devices (particularly X11) considerable speedups in display
can be achieved by not flushing each graphics primitive call to the
actual display until necessary. M_draw automatically delays flushing in
the following cases:
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
Within a callobj() call.
.IP \(bu 3
Within curves and patches.
.IP \(bu 3
Within Hershey software text.
.IP \(bu 3
When double buffering (the flush is only done within swapbuffers).
.RE
.PP
There are two user routines that can be used to control flushing.

.PP
Viewpoint routines alter the current transformation matrix.
.SS   GETTING THE ASPECT DETAILS
.TP
.B getaspect()
Returns the ratio height over width of the display device.
.TP
.B getfactors(wfact, hfact)
Returns width over min(width of device, height of device) and height over min(width of
device, height of device).
.TP
.B getdisplaysize(w, h)
Returns width and height of device in device units
.PP
Often the screen is not perfectly square and it would be nice to use
the extra space without having to turn clipping off. The following
routines are provided to get the values needed to adjust the calls
to viewport, etc as needed.
.SS   ATTRIBUTE STACK ROUTINES
.TP
.B pushattributes()
Save the current attributes on the attribute stack.
.TP
.B popattributes()
Restore attributes to what they were at last pushattributes().
.PP
The attribute stack contains details such as current color, filling,
hatching, centered, fixedwidth, text height, text width, and the
current font. If you need to prevent object calls from changing these,
use pushattributes before the call and popattributes after.
.SS   PROJECTION ROUTINES
.TP
.B ortho(left, right, bottom, top,near,far)
Define x,y,z clipping planes.
.TP
.B ortho2(left, right, bottom, top)
Define x and y clipping planes.

create a window of the specified size and then
set the viewport to the largest viewport with
that aspect so that output acts much like a
page of paper of the specified size without
distortion.
.PP
All the projection routines define a new transformation matrix, and
consequently the world units. Parallel projections are defined by
ortho or ortho2. Perspective projections can be defined by perspective
and window.
.SS   MATRIX STACK ROUTINES
.TP
.B pushmatrix()
Save the current transformation matrix on the matrix stack.
.TP
.B popmatrix()
Reinstall the last matrix pushed
.SS   VIEWPOINT ROUTINES
.TP
.B polarview(dist, azim, inc, twist)
Specify the viewer's position in polar coordinates
.TP
.B up(x, y, z)
Specify the world up.
.TP
.B lookat(vx, vy, vz, px, py, pz,twist)
Specify the viewer's position
.SS   MOVE ROUTINES
.TP
.B move(x, y, z)
Move current graphics position to (x, y, z)
.TP
.B rmove(deltax, deltay, deltaz)
Relative move
.TP
.B move2(x, y)
Move graphics position to point (x, y)
.TP
.B rmove2(deltax, deltay)
Relative move in world units.
.TP
.B smove2(x, y)
Move current graphics position in screen coordinates (\fB-1.0\fP to 1.0).
.TP
.B rsmove2(deltax, deltay)
Relative move in screen units (\fB-1.0\fP to 1.0).
.SS   LINESTYLE ROUTINES
.TP
.B linewidth()
set line width in rasters
.TP
.B dashcode()
set dash pattern length
.TP
.B linestyle()
set the line dash pattern
.PP
Linestyles are specified by giving a nominal length of a single
dash and a character string consisting of 1's and 0's (zeros) that
specify when to draw a dash and when not to draw a dash. Linestyles
will follow curves and "go around" corners. If a linestyle is set or
reset, the accumulated information as to where on a curve (or line)
a dash is to be draw is also reset.
.PP
For EXAMPLE, with a nominal view of \fB-1\fP to 1, setting the dash length
to 0.5, and the linestyle to '11010' would draw a line(or curve) with
a 1.0 unit solid part, followed by a 0.5 unit blank part followed by
a 0.5 unit solid part followed by a 0.5 unit blank part. The linestyle
would then repeat itself.
.PP
The dash sizes are affected by the current viewport/transformation
scaling factors, meaning that in perspective, the dashes look smaller
the farther away they are.
.SS   DRAW ROUTINES
.TP
.B draw(x, y, z)
Draw from current graphics position to (x, y, z)
.TP
.B rdraw(deltax, deltay, deltaz)
Relative draw
.TP
.B draw2(x, y)
Draw from current graphics position to point (x, y)
.TP
.B rdraw2(deltax,deltay)
Relative draw
.TP
.B sdraw2(x, y)
Draw in screen coordinates (\fB-1.0\fP to 1.0).
.TP
.B rsdraw2(deltax, deltay)
Relative draw in screen units (\fB-1.0\fP to 1.0).
.SS   ARCS AND CIRCLES
.TP
.B circleprecision(nsegs)
Set number of line segments in a circle. Default is 32.
.TP
.B arc(x, y, radius, startang, endang)

.TP
.B sector(x, y, radius, startang,endang)
Draw a sector. Note: sectors are polygons.
.TP
.B circle(x, y, radius)

.PP
When creating arcs and sectors note that angles are
measured in degrees; where zero(0) is the positive X axis in a
right-handed Cartesian coordinate system and positive angles sweep
counterclockwise. If filling sectors or circles (As described in the
section on polygons) hatch pitch is measured in world coordinates
and is initially set to 0.1. The initial hatch angle is zero(0).

.PP
A polygon is composed of a number of coplanar line segments connected
end to end to form a closed shape.
.PP
In M_draw curves are estimated by a series of line segments, and thus
may be included easily into polygons.
.TP
.B Regular
A polygon with all sides and interior angles the same. Regular
polygons are always convex. See Regular Polygons
.TP
.B Irregular
Each side may a different length, each angle may be a different
measure. The opposite of a regular polygon. See Irregular Polygons
.TP
.B Convex
All interior angles less than 180 ,and all vertices 'point
outwards' away from the interior. The opposite of concave. Regular
polygons are always convex. See Convex Polygons
.TP
.B Concave
One or more interior angles greater than 180 . Some vertices
push 'inwards' towards the interior of the polygon. The opposite
of convex.
.TP
.B Self-intersecting or Crossed
A polygon where one or more sides crosses back over another side,
creating multiple smaller polygons. Most of the properties and
theorems concerning polygons do not apply to this shape. It is
best considered as several separate polygons. A polygon that in
not self-intersecting in this way is called a simple polygon.

.PP
M_draw supports hardware and software fonts. The software fonts are based
on the character set digitized by Dr Allen V. Hershey while working at
the U. S. National Bureau of Standards. Exactly what hardware fonts are
supported depends on the device, but it is guaranteed that the names
"large" and "small" will result in something readable. For X11 displays
the default large and small fonts used by the program can be overridden
by placing the following defaults in the ~/.Xdefaults file:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
     draw.smallfont: X11-font-name
     draw.largefont: X11-font-name

.fam T
.fi
It is noted here that hardware text is always assumed to be drawn
parallel to the (x, y) plane, using whatever the current z coordinate
is. The following software fonts are supported:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
      astrology       cursive         cyrillic        futura.l
      futura.m        gothic.eng      gothic.ger      gothic.ita
      greek           markers         math.low        math.upp

      times.rb        japanese

.fam T
.fi
A markers font "markers" is also provided for doing markers - you need
to have centertext mode on for this to give sensible results when placing
the markers.
.PP
If the environment variable "M_DRAW_FONTPATH" is set M_draw looks for the software
fonts in the directory given by this value.
.PP
the default font is futura.l
.SS   TRANSFORMATION ROUTINES
.TP
.B translate(x, y, z)
Set up a translation.
.TP
.B scale(x, y, z)
Set up scaling factors in x, y, and z axis.
.TP
.B rotate(angle, axis)
Set up a rotation in axis axis where axis is one of 'x','y', or 'z'.
.PP
All transformations are cumulative, so if you rotate something and
then do a translate you are translating relative to the rotated
axes. If you need to preserve the current transformation matrix use
pushmatrix(), do the drawing, and then call popmatrix() to get back
where you were before.
.PP
When doing transformations, ensure your objects remain in the viewing
volume or they will be clipped. See routines such as ortho(3) for
more information.
.SS   PATCH ROUTINES
.TP
.B patchbasis(tbasis, ubasis)
Define the t and u basis matrices of a patch.
.TP
.B patchprecision(tseg, useg)
Set minimum number of line segments making up curves in a patch.
.TP
.B patchcurves(nt, nu)
Set the number of curves making up a patch.
.TP
.B rpatch(gx, gy, gz, gw)
Draws a rational patch in the current basis, according to the geometry matrices gx, gy, gz, and gw.
.TP
.B patch(gx, gy, gz)
Draws a patch in the current basis, according to the geometry matrices gx, gy, and gz.
.SS   POINT ROUTINES
.TP
.B point(x, y, z)
Draw a point at x, y, z
.TP
.B point2(x, y)
Draw a point at x, y.
.PP
points are drawn with the current color and linewidth. Points are
currently device-specific and may appear as circles, squares, or
not at all; as they are generated by a zero-length vector using the
hardware line style.
.SS   OBJECT ROUTINES
.TP
.B makeobj(n)
Commence the object number n.
.TP
.B closeobj()
Close the current object.
.TP
.B genobj()
Returns a unique object identifier.
.TP
.B getopenobj()
Return the number of the current object.
.TP
.B callobj(n)
Draw object number n.
.TP
.B isobj(n)
Returns non-zero if there is an object of number n.
.TP
.B delobj(n)
Delete the object number n.
.TP
.B loadobj(n, filename)
Load the object in the file filename as object number n.
.TP
.B saveobj(n, filename)
Save object number n into file filename. Does NOT save objects called inside object n.
.TP
.B invokeobj(xt,yt,zt,xs,ys,zs,xr,yr,zr,iobject)
push environment and do a transformation and then pop environment
.PP
Objects are graphical entities created by the drawing routines called
between makeobj and closeobj. Objects may be called from within other
objects. When an object is created most of the calculations required
by the drawing routines called within it are done up to where the
calculations involve the current transformation matrix. So if you need to
draw the same thing several times on the screen but in different places
it is faster to use objects than to call the appropriate drawing routines
each time. Objects also have the advantage of being savable to a file,
from where they can be reloaded for later reuse. Routines which draw
or move in screen coordinates, or change device, cannot be included
in objects.
.SS   DOUBLE BUFFERING
.TP
.B backbuffer()
Draw in the backbuffer. Returns \fB-1\fP if the device is not up to it.
.TP
.B frontbuffer()
Draw in the front buffer. This will always work.
.TP
.B swapbuffers()
Swap the front and back buffers.
.PP
Where possible M_draw allows for front and back buffers to enable
things like animation and smooth updating of the screen. The routine
backbuffer is used to initialise double buffering.
.SS   POSITION ROUTINES
.TP
.B getgp(x, y, z)
Gets the current graphics position
.TP
.B getgpt(x, y, z, w)
Gets the current transformed graphics position in world coords.

.SH BUGS

Polygon hatching will give unexpected results unless the polygon is
initially defined in the X-Y plane.
.PP
Double buffering isn't supported on all devices.
.PP
We don't recommend the use of the smove/sdraw routines.
.PP
The yobbarays may be turned on or they may be turned off.
.PP
When creating an object, current position and text size are not
actually changed so almost any query routine to get position or font
size or whatever will not work properly.
.PP
If call vexit(3f) and then call vinit(3f) everything should probably
be reset to initial values at program startup, such as linewidth,
current font, and color. It is currently left up to the output device
initialization routine. It should not be. To minimize the issue,
call all the push* routines after a vinit(3f) and call all the pop*
routines before vexit(3f).
.PP
Exactly what attributes should and should not be reset with a
vnewdev(3f) is questionable.
